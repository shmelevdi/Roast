# The Roast PHP-Framework

What is a Roast? Roast - a simple PHP framework for a clean API and for nothing more.

There are no view-controllers in it. All responses can be received only in JSON, XML, Text\Plain formats.

The philosophy of the framework divides its logical parts into controllers and models.

As an ORM, the framework uses [RedBeanPHP 5](https://github.com/gabordemooij/redbean).


You can create a project of the Roast framework using the Composer (^v.2.0):

`composer create-project shmelevdi/roast`
